# Car Accident and Alcohol Detection System

Welcome to the Car Accident and Alcohol Detection System project repository! This system is designed to detect car accidents and alcohol presence in the driver to enhance road safety.

## Overview

The Car Accident and Alcohol Detection System utilizes various sensors and modules to detect car accidents and monitor the driver's alcohol level. This project aims to prevent accidents caused by drunk driving by providing real-time alerts and notifications.

## Technologies Used

### Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. In this project, Arduino is used to interface with sensors, process data, and control actuators.

### Proteus
Proteus is a simulation and design software tool suite used for electronic design automation. It allows for the simulation of Arduino-based circuits and systems before hardware implementation.

### Sensors and Modules
- Gas Sensor: Detects alcohol presence in the driver's breath.
- GPS Module: Determines the vehicle's location in case of an accident.
- GSM Module: Sends SMS alerts to emergency contacts in case of an accident.
- Infrared Sensor: Detects obstacles or collisions.
- Vibration Sensor: Detects sudden changes or impacts indicative of an accident.

## Features

- **Accident Detection**: Utilizes vibration and infrared sensors to detect car accidents.
- **Alcohol Detection**: Monitors the driver's alcohol level using the gas sensor.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Sends SMS alerts with the vehicle's location to emergency contacts in case of an accident.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time monitoring of the vehicle's status and the driver's condition.

## Getting Started

To simulate the Car Accident and Alcohol Detection System using Proteus, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Proteus if you haven't already.
2. Open the Proteus workspace file (`Car_Accident_Detection_System_Proteus_Code.pdsprj`).
3. Simulate the Arduino code and sensor interactions within Proteus.

For the Arduino code implementation, upload the `Car Accident Detection Aruduino code.ino` file to your Arduino board.
